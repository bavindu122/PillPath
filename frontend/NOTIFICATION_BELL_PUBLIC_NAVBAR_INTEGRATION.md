## Overview
Integrated the notification bell system into the public-facing navigation components (Navbar, DesktopNav, and MobileFloatingNav) so authenticated users can access notifications from any page in the application.

## Components Updated

### 1. Navbar.jsx (Main Navigation Bar)
**Location**: `src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx`

**Changes**:
- âœ… Removed static `BellDot` icon and hardcoded notification count

- âœ… Replaced static bell with `<NavbarBell position="left" />`

**Before**:
```jsx
<div className="relative group">
  <div className="p-2 rounded-full navbar-hover-bg navbar-hover-bg-blue cursor-pointer">
    <BellDot className="w-5 h-5 navbar-text-secondary group-hover:navbar-blue-text" />
  </div>
  <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 navbar-notification-badge text-xs rounded-full h-5 w-5">
    3
  </span>
</div>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<NavbarBell position="left" />
```

      <Bell size={20} className={unreadCount > 0 ? 'animate-bellRing' : ''} />
      
      {unreadCount > 0 && (
        <span className="...badge-styles...">
          {unreadCount > 99 ? '99+' : unreadCount}
        </span>
      )}

- Badge: Animated pulse (`animate-badgePulse`)
- Badge shows "99+" for counts over 99

- Unread notifications highlighted (purple background)
- Actions available: mark as read, mark all as read, delete, refresh
- Click outside or ESC to close

### 5. User Interacts with Notification

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

**Desktop (â‰¥ md)**:
```jsx
<div className="hidden md:flex items-center gap-4">
  <NavbarBell position="left" />
</div>
```

**Mobile (< lg)**:
```jsx
<div className="block lg:hidden fixed bottom-4">
  <MobileFloatingNav />
  {/* Bell integrated inside */}
</div>
```

### Dropdown Positioning

**Desktop Navbar Bell**:
- Position: `left` (dropdown opens left-aligned)
- Anchored to top navbar bell icon
- Opens downward

**Mobile Bottom Nav Bell**:
- Position: `right` (dropdown opens right-aligned)
- Anchored to bottom nav bell icon
- Opens upward (automatically calculated by `getDropdownStyle()`)

---

## Accessibility

### ARIA Attributes
```jsx
aria-label={`Notifications${unreadCount > 0 ? ` (${unreadCount} unread)` : ''}`}
aria-expanded={isDropdownOpen}
aria-haspopup="dialog"
```

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Tab**: Navigate through bell and dropdown elements
- **Shift+Tab**: Navigate backward
- **ESC**: Close dropdown and return focus to bell
- **Enter/Space**: Activate bell button

### Screen Reader Support
- Bell button announces notification count
- Unread badge has `aria-label` with count
- Dropdown has proper `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`

---

## Integration Points

### Context Provider
All notification components use `NotificationsContext`:

```jsx
// App.jsx
<NotificationsProvider>
  <AppContent />
</NotificationsProvider>
```

### Shared State
```jsx
const { notifications, unreadCount, markAsRead, deleteNotification } = useNotifications();
```

All bell instances (navbar, mobile, customer floating, pharmacist header, pharmacy admin header) share the same notification state via context.
